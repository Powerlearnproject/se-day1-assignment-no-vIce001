Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
  Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power aspects of modern life, including: communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include:
  The development of programming languages. The first high-level programming language, FORTRAN, was  released in 1957.
  The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s. The term "software engineering" was coined during this period.
  The advent of structured programming programming. A new number of methodologies, including structured programming and object-oriented programming, were developed in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  The phases of Software Development Cycle consists of:
  1.Requirments: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirments.
  2.Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  3.Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specification.
  4.Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  5.Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  6.Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases- requirments, design, implementation- flowing downwards lika a waterfall while agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Agile is best for dynamic teams that frequently change members throughout the project life cycle, or for teams that assign specific team members to multiple roles while Waterfall, on the other hand, works best for established teams and where each member is given a specific role

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
 Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples include: Visual Studio and  Eclipse.
  Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples include: Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Common challenges faced by software engineers include:
  1.Changing requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle,
    leading to scope creep and project delays.
  2.Tight deadlines:  Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  3.Technical debt:  Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. 
  Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
  Integration testing involves testing iteractions between different components or subsystems.
  System testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
  Acceptance testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  The importance of quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration is that they  help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering entails crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI.
Prompt engineering helps avoid asking AI vague questions and getting confusing answers from it by making questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is, 'What are elephants?'. To get a more focused response I could write, 'What are the different species of elephants on the Afro-Eurasia landmass?'. This prompt is more effective because it's more specific, concise and clearer than the first prompt.
